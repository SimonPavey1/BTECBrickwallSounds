    <p>Charl is the man who funds this entire operation. Without him, we'd be stuck working for a fuel company or something ridiculous. </p>
    <p>Charl can often be found listening to finance podcasts at 2x speed</p>
    <p>He loves to learn through osmosis</p>
    <p>Sometimes, for fun, he deletes his own websites, purely for the thrill</p>
